# ScanTool
Scan local drives for files above 50.000.000 bytes

This script has been created for searching thru the local disks of PC's on the network. 
The script is deployed by GPO and run on the workstation itself.

With the fileSize variable, a minimum filesize can be set. So not all small files will end up in the log.
